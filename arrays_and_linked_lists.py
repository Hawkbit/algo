# arrays and linked lists  - ways to store data
# sorting algorithms may be needed - selection sort
# selection sort is a stepping stone to quick sort
#
# arrays - good for things sorted in a line, but problems come when
# items get broken up in memory - which can be countered by reserving memory,
# though if the memory isn't used, then it's wasted.
#
# linked lists - items can be anywhere in memory and the items are linked
# by memory addresses. However, linked lists can be long because each item
# has to be read sequentially.
#
# array terminology - index(position of element)
#
#             array     list
# reading      O(1)     O(n)
# insertion    O(n)     O(1)
# deletion     O(n)     O(1)
# O(n) = linear time
# O(1) = constant time
#
# Inserting in the middle of a list
# lists are better for inserting elements in middle and/or deleting items

# random access - arrays
# sequential access - linked list
